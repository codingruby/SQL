-- This project I went ahead myself and found a dataset on Kaggle. It is Formula 1 Race Data from the years 1950 to 2017. 
Using SQLite Studio I extracted information from the dataset with a number of SQl queries.

## Who were the drivers with the most wins each season? Limit to 3 drivers.
WITH SeasonWins AS (
SELECT r.year, d.forename, d.surname, COUNT(*) AS Wins,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY r.year ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) as Rank
FROM results res
JOIN drivers d
ON res.driverId = d.driverId
JOIN races r
ON r.raceId = res.raceId
WHERE res.positionOrder = 1 
GROUP BY r.year, d.driverId
)
SELECT year, forename, surname, Wins
FROM SeasonWins
WHERE Rank <= 3
ORDER BY year ASC, Wins DESC;

## What is the average pitstop times over the years?
SELECT year, AVG(duration) AS AveragePitStopTime 
FROM races 
JOIN pitstops
ON races.raceId = pitstops.raceId
GROUP BY year;

## Teams with the most constructors championship?
SELECT name, COUNT(*) AS Championships
FROM constructors c
JOIN constructor_standings cs
ON c.constructorId = cs.constructorId
GROUP BY name
ORDER BY Championships DESC;

## Which circuit has hosted the most races?
SELECT circuitId, name, COUNT(*) AS race_count
FROM races
GROUP BY circuitId
ORDER BY race_count DESC
LIMIT 1;

## Which country has produced the most drivers?
SELECT nationality, COUNT(*) AS driver_count
FROM drivers
GROUP BY nationality
ORDER BY driver_count DESC
LIMIT 1;

## Which driver has the most pole positions?
SELECT q.driverId, forename, surname, COUNT(*) as pole_count
FROM qualifying q
JOIN drivers d
ON d.driverId = q.driverId
WHERE position = 1
GROUP BY q.driverId
ORDER BY pole_count DESC
LIMIT 1;
