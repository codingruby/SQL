#In this PostgreSQL code project, I'm querying a database that's holding Nexflix data to answer questions about the data. 

#1. How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows) 
SELECT COUNT(title)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
WHERE titles.type = 'Movie';

#2. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database? 
SELECT MAX(date(date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

#3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order. 
SELECT title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title ASC;

#4. Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star? 
SELECT director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
ON people.show_id = titles.show_id
WHERE titles.type = 'Movie' AND titles.title IN ('Bright Star');

--or it could be written like that

SELECT director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
LEFT JOIN  "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
ON titles.show_id = people.show_id
WHERE titles.title = 'Bright Star';

#5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made? 
SELECT title, release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie'
ORDER BY release_year ASC
LIMIT 1;
